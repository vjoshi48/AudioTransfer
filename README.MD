This folder is comprised of 3 different files. 

-The main file is the ModelTraining.ipynb.
-This file can be run as to see how the model training was done and to generate loss plots. 
-The model requires a HIGH amount of memory, so unless there is a usable GPU, this 
will likely run out of memory.

-GeneratingImageDataset.ipynb shows how we generated the images we used for training.

-ChangingImageSize.ipyng shows how we split the images in half to fit them into memory.

-The 90_rock and trap folders contain our audio dataset.

-The Fake Audio contains audio generated by our model.

-The Fake Images containts images generated by our model.

-The Images contains the images we used to train our model.
